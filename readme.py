#Description:
# A program which returns the Nato Alphabet
# for the word that you input
# i.e input = "Andy"
# i.e return = "Alpha, November, Delta, Yankee"

#Things I learned today:
# List Comprehension (  new_list = [new_item for item in list]  )
# Works with Strings too i.e ("Andy" = "A", "n", "d", "y")
# Conditional List Comprehension (  new_list = [new_item for item in list if test]  )
# Dictionary Comprehension
# How to Iterate over a Pandas DataFrame
